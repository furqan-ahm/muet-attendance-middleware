# MUET Attendance Retrieval Server

Simple socketio server for retrieving attendance from mehran university website using their api,

# Only works on their network
Meaning that you either have to have a physical machine on their network or
you can host an ec2-instance on any platform (aws, gcp) and then connect that instance to mehrans network using university provided pptp vpn credentials

I used CentOS7 image on aws to host the server.
